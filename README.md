# CMPT276-MY-DEMO
Hello! Welcome to the demo.

# Scenario 1
You are working on a project cloned from `GitHub`. You just made a small text edit in an `HTML` file. Your teammates also pushed changes to main. You'll now need to using `Git`:
- create and switch branches 
- push via upstream 
- fetch and merge 
- use reset, rebase, branch cleanup
- view history
